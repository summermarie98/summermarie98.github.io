	<p>For our intense project, we decided to create a multiplayer game where two players interact with each other through intense battle.
	With the use of rockets and bouncing enemies our game creates a competitive vibe that the whole family will love. 
	We decided for player 1 to use the WASD keys to move and the spacebar to fire rockets at player 2. 
	For player 2, we decided that the player uses arrow keys to move and the number 0 to fire rockets at player 1. 
	We faced many obstacles while creating our game, especially when programing the amount of points each player receives.
	Finally, we fixed most of the mistakes and made it easier for the players, enemies, and rockets to move properly.
	We also included an aesthetic appeal, so the players find the game visually pleasing.
	In the end, we were very proud with our project, even though we faced many challenges.</p>
	
	<p>During this project, there were times when I was confused or frustrated due to certain parts of the multiplayer game not functioning correctly.
	Overtime the game started to come together more and more, which was a huge deal. 
	I was thankful to have such an outstanding partner like Alyssia, since she really helped solve little mistakes when we got stuck. 
	Overall, it was a great experience!</p>
