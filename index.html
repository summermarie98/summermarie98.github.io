	<p align=center style="font-family:verdana" style="font-size:20px"> Welcome to this splendid website! My current multiplayer game screenshots that I created with Alyssia Gabbard, will be displayed here!</p>

	<p align=center style="font-family:verdana"> For our intense project, we decided to create a multiplayer game where two players interact with each other through intense battle.
	With the use of rockets and bouncing enemies our game creates a competitive vibe that the whole family will love. 
	We decided for player 1 to use the WASD keys to move and the spacebar to fire rockets at player 2. 
	For player 2, we decided that the player uses arrow keys to move and the number 0 to fire rockets at player 1. 
	We faced many obstacles while creating our game, especially when programing the amount of points each player receives.
	Finally, we fixed most of the mistakes and made it easier for the players, enemies, and rockets to move properly.
	We also included an aesthetic appeal, so the players find the game visually pleasing.
	In the end, we were very proud with our project, even though we faced many challenges.</p>

	<p align=center style="font-family:verdana"> During this project, there were times when I was confused or frustrated due to certain parts of the multiplayer game not functioning correctly.
	Overtime the game started to come together more and more, which was a huge deal. 
	I was thankful to have such an outstanding partner like Alyssia, since she really helped solve little mistakes when we got stuck. 
	Overall, it was a great experience!</p>

	<p align=center style="font-family:verdana"> In this screenshot, Alyssia and I started out by creating the enemies (red rectangles) that bounce from side to side to block any missiles fired by each opponent. 
	Each opponent's mission is to fire missiles at the opposing player till you reach the maximum score of the desired score,
	while in the demo's case it would be 10. In the next screenshot, you will see the area in which encountered some issues.

	<p align=center style="font-family:verdana"> In this screenshot, the coding presented shows the area where we had the most issues that resulted in glitches and simply the game not working.
	In this coding, we were trying to accomplish the overall idea of when the players fired and hit one another, they would receive points that calculated in the score board.
	What ended up happening is that when we fired missiles it resulted in no change to the score board and at times the missiles would stop midway when fired.
	Later on down the road, we went through our entire coding again and resolved the issue, so that it would calculate for the player on the score board.

	<p align=center style="font-family:verdana"> In this last screenshot, my partner Alyssia and I present the finished product, where it shows no glitches happening anymore. 
	In the game, we created an "IF" statement that would allow the score of each player to change.
	It also displays the near-win of Player 2 (a.k.a yours truly), in which they received 8 points and Player 1 has 6 points.
	In the end, it would display in the score board the following saying "Player_Wins!" 
	Overall, the game ended up being a success and I was happy to be apart of it in the making.</p>
	
	<p align=center style="font-family:verdana" style="font-size:20px"> I hope you enjoyed our little intense game! :-)</p>
